## About

[SQL Server][mssql-docs] is a relational database management system (RDBMS)
developed by Microsoft that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage large
amount of data through a structured format.

## Requirements

### Database User

This source uses standard authentication by default. You will need to [create a
SQL Server user][mssql-users] to login to the database with.

For an Azure SQL server with SQL authentication disabled, set `azureAuth` instead and
omit `user` and `password`. The identity you authenticate as still needs a database
user, created [from the external provider][mssql-entra-users].

To have each request run under the identity of the person who made it instead of
a shared one, see [Authenticating as the caller](#authenticating-as-the-caller).

[mssql-users]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-database-user?view=sql-server-ver16
[mssql-entra-users]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure#create-contained-database-users-in-your-database-mapped-to-microsoft-entra-identities

## Example

```yaml
kind: source
name: my-mssql-source
type: mssql
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 1433
database: my_db
user: ${USER_NAME}
password: ${PASSWORD}
# encrypt: strict
```

### Microsoft Entra ID

```yaml
kind: source
name: my-azure-sql-source
type: mssql
host: my-server.database.windows.net
port: 1433
database: my_db
encrypt: strict
azureAuth:
  mode: workload-identity
  clientId: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
```

{{< notice tip >}}
Use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.

| clientId                   |  string  |    false     | Client ID of the identity. Set it where a host maps to more than one identity, so the credential is not left to be guessed. Required together with `tenantId`, and always in `service-principal` mode.                         |
| tenantId                   |  string  |    false     | Tenant ID, where it cannot be inferred from the server.                                                                                            |

## Advanced Usage

### Authenticating as the caller

By default every tool call reaches the database over one connection pool, under
the identity in the configuration. Setting `useClientOAuth` changes that: Toolbox
takes the access token the client sent, connects as that person, and keeps a
separate pool per caller. The database then applies their own permissions and
row-level security, and refuses what they may not read — enforcement that does
not depend on the tool, the prompt or the model.

This requires a SQL Server that accepts Microsoft Entra ID authentication, such
as [Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance][azure-sql-entra], and a
database user (or Entra group) for each person who will query it.

[azure-sql-entra]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview

Which token the database is given depends on who the client's token was issued
for:

- **The client already holds a token for the database.** Omit `azureOnBehalfOf`
  and the token is passed on as it arrived.
- **The client authenticated against Toolbox** — the usual case, since an MCP
  client requests a token for the server it is talking to. Configure
  `azureOnBehalfOf` and the driver exchanges that token for a database-scoped one
  using the [on-behalf-of flow][obo-flow]. The application it names must hold the
  delegated permission `user_impersonation` on Azure SQL Database, with consent
  granted, and the client's token must have been issued for that application.

[obo-flow]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow

```yaml
kind: source
name: my-mssql-source
type: mssql
host: my-server.database.windows.net
port: 1433
database: my_db
# No user or password: the identity comes from whoever called the tool.
useClientOAuth: "true"
azureOnBehalfOf:
    clientId: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
    tenantId: ${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
```

{{< notice note >}}
A request that arrives without a token is refused rather than falling back to a
shared identity. Because there is no identity of its own to connect with, this
source does not verify the connection at startup: the first request carrying a
token is what proves the database is reachable.
